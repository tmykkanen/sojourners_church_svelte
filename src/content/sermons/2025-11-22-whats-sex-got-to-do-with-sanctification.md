Sermon on 1 Thessalonians 4:3-8 from ⁠Sojourners Church ⁠in Albert Lea, MN. Preached on November 2, 2025 by Pastor Tyler Mykkanen.

Argument: Misusing the good gift of sex will destroy your enjoyment of the greater gift of sanctification.

1. Sanctification is sharing in the character of God.
2. Sanctification is sharing in the joy of intimacy with God.
